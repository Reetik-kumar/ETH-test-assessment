This Solidity contract, `MyToken`, defines a basic cryptocurrency with a token name, abbrev, and total supply. It includes a mapping to track balances, a `mint` function to create new tokens, and a `burn` function to destroy tokens. This allows for simple token management on the Ethereum blockchain, suitable for rewards or  financial applications.
